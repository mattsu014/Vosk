## Introduction
What is [VOSK](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/)? VOSK is a powerful tool for real-time speech recognition that does not require an internet connection. Developed by [Alpha Cephei](https://alphacephei.com/en/), it supports multiple languages and is highly efficient. It can even run on low-performance devices, such as the Raspberry Pi.

## Using VOSK
To use VOSK, you first need to download the model from this website: [https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models)

VOSK offers models for many languages, including Portuguese, English, Japanese, and others:

Once you download the ZIP file containing the VOSK model, you will need to unzip it

## Install Dependences
**First**, you need to install the VOSK package and PyAudio using the following command:

```
pip install vosk pyaudio
```
PyAudio is a library that allows you to capture and reproduce audio using the PortAudio API. In this code, PyAudio is used to:

- Open the microphone.
- Capture audio in real time.
- Collect audio data to Vosk for processing.

## Let's Code!!!
Code Exemple:

```
import pyaudio
import json
from vosk import Model, KaldiRecognizer

model = Model("vosk-model-en-us-0.22")
recognizer = KaldiRecognizer(model, 16000)

p = pyaudio.PyAudio()
stream = p.open(format=pyaudio.paInt16, channels=1, rate=16000, input=True, frames_per_buffer=8192)
stream.start_stream()

print("listening...")

while True:
    data = stream.read(4096, exception_on_overflow=False)
    if recognizer.AcceptWaveform(data):
        result = json.loads(recognizer.Result())
        print("VocÃª disse:", result["text"])

```
I created this simple example code to demonstrate how VOSK works.

**1. Library Imports**

```
import pyaudio
import json
from vosk import Model, KaldiRecognizer
```

It's a simple import library

**2. Speech recognition model loading**

```
model = Model("vosk-model-en-us-0.22")
```
This loads the VOSK model for English (US).
**3. Speech recognizer initialization**

```
recognizer = KaldiRecognizer(model, 16000)
```

- **KaldiRecognizer:** Starts Speech Recognition model with 16000 Hz (16 kHz) sampling rate, commum sampling rate for Speech Recognition

**4. Audio Settings**

```
p = pyaudio.PyAudio()
stream = p.open(format=pyaudio.paInt16, channels=1, rate=16000, input=True, frames_per_buffer=8192)
stream.start_stream()
```
- **pyaudio.PyAudio():** Initializes the PyAudio object, which is used to configure and manage audio capture.

- **p.open():** Opens an audio stream with the following settings:

- **format=pyaudio.paInt16:** Audio format of 16 bits.

- **channels=1:** Mono audio (1 channel).

- **rate=16000:** Sampling rate of 16000 Hz.

- **input=True:** Indicates that the stream will be used for audio input (capture).

- **frames_per_buffer=8192:** Size of the audio buffer.

- **stream.start_stream():** Starts the audio capture.

**5. Speech Recognition Loop**

```
print("listening...")

while True:
    data = stream.read(4096, exception_on_overflow=False)
    if recognizer.AcceptWaveform(data):
        result = json.loads(recognizer.Result())
        print("You said:", result["text"])
```

- **stream.read(4096, exception_on_overflow=False):**
 Reads 4096 frames of audio from the stream. The exception_on_overflow=False parameter prevents the program from raising an exception in case of overflow.

- **recognizer.AcceptWaveform(data):** Sends the audio data to the speech recognizer. If the recognizer detects a complete phrase, it returns True.

- **json.loads(recognizer.Result()):** Converts the speech recognition result (which is in JSON format) into a Python dictionary.

## Conclusion
VOSK is a powerful and efficient tool for real-time speech recognition, supporting multiple languages and running seamlessly on low-performance devices like the Raspberry Pi. 
Its offline capability makes it ideal for applications where internet access is limited. 
With this guide, youâ€™ve learned how to set up VOSK, configure audio capture, and implement a basic speech recognition system. 
Whether for voice-controlled apps, transcription tools, or language learning, VOSK offers a simple yet robust solution for integrating speech recognition into your projects.
